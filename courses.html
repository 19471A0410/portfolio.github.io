        </h1>
            <p>An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and 
                optimized computer programs. Our DSA tutorial will guide you to learn different types of data structures and algorithms and their 
                implementations in Java.</p>
